# AA024-MCU-Demo
Interfaces a GMR sensor to an ATtiny85 microcontrollers, which does a simple four-segment piecewise-linear calibration algorithm. The calibrated or uncalibrated outputs are displayed on a digital meter. The microcontroller includes a Trinket bootloader and the convenient Arduino IDE for programming.
